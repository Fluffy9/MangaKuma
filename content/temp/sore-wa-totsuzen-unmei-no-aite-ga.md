description: " Imagine a country where couples are chosen based on the compatibility of their genes. Whenever a resident reaches the age of 14, a partner will be suggested to him or her based on which match would result in the best child being born. This is a collection of stories about some of the more 'interesting' pairings chosen by this system."
