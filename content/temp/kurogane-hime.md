description: "The Japanese government developed a military project where they created Tekki, schoolgirls who were altered to strengthen their body by replacing their bones with steel and artificial muscles. The Tekki are experts with the katana and are allowed to fight in the streets to determine the cream of the crop. Those who repair the Tekki are medical experts called Tougi and they work to maintain and improve the girls."
