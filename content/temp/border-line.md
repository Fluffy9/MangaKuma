However, only Mizoguchi, one of the members, understood him. Sakaguchiâ€™s uncertainty stepped in before their term ended. Where is the borderline between friends and lovers? When their bodies touched, that borderline fused together with their feelings. When they met again later, would the borderline still exist?"
