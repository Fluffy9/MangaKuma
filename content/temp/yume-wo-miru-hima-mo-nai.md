description: "Kawamura Kazuya had dreamt of being a pilot when he was young. Thus when he heard that there's an aviation school five hours from where he stayed, Kawamura enrolled without giving much thought. He was placed in the same room with two other room mates. One of them, Itou, dropped out when he couldn't stand the tough life. This left Kawamura with Yoshitake, a tall, quiet and non-responsive guy."
