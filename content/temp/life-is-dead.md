description: "Zombies can turn humans by both biting them and as a STD. There are also levels of Zombification. Now that this virus is running rampant the government is trying to control it by putting a collar on ever zombie over level 3. Unfortunately for Yukio, he is a level 3. This is his story (or at least that's how it's looking)."
