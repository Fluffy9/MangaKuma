description: "Yukinari was abandoned as an infant, but fortunately a loving family adopted him. Perhaps because of this, he has an affinity for helpless, abandoned creatures and goes out of his way to help them. One night, Yukinari and his friends witness a falling star hit the ground and rush to the spot where it hit, only to find a child cradled in the meteorite, surrounded by a field of roses?!"
