description: "From Dan of Population GO: The Momoru Club, is full of odd people acting, well, oddly. The goal of the club it is reflected in its full name 'The Liven Up The Moyama Shopping District Club'. However, most members cannot do even the most basic of service related tasks. It is good that these characters act oddly, how else are they going to liven up the Moyama Shopping District?"
