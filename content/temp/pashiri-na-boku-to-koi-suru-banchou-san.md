description: "Unoki-kun, a boy who's been bullied since elementary school, ends up becoming the exclusive errand boy of the top delinquent of his school, Toramaru-san, who told him 'Be mine' right after entering high school. But the truth is that Toramaru-san meant it as a confession of love!! This is the beginning of a love misunderstanding between Toramaru-san, who thinks she's in a relationship, and Unoki-kun, who think he's being bullied."
