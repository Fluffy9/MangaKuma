description: "2050, Tokyo. The sixteen year old, special gifted police detective Kyouko Karasuma works for a special devision in the Asakusa Police Department. Her rather abnormal cases involve: she's fighting against Oni, Tengu and other monsters from the Asian myths and legends. The modern art by the character designer of Speed Grapher works very good with the action-heavy story line and the overall art improves with each volume. -Bakaupdates"
