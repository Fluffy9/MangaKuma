description: "From Seven Seas: Meet Kanae, an introvert who is about to have her life transformed in the most unusual of ways: through music. For Kanae, her transformation begins when she accidentally bumps into Hina, an independent singer who releases her music via the Internet. As the pair become good friends, they quickly find that they've become one another's inspiration--in more ways than one."
