description: "This is my duty as a butler... Son of the marquis, Nicholas has strawberry-red hair, honey-yellow eyes, and syrupy smooth skin. At his side at all times is Eim, his butler. Though Nicholas has already grown up, Eim still loyally bathes his master. One night, Eim walks in on Nicholas fantasizing about his butlerâ€™s true feelings... Includes the love story of an idling instructor and a young knight-in-training!"
