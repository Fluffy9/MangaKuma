description: "Even as he tries to keep the student council president - who unwittingly exude his powerful, man-seducing charm - out of trouble, Vice President Chiga-kun finds himself being drawn to the president's strength and power. Chiga-kun wonders how he, being such an intelligent individual, can be so unwillingly taken with a boy who is so country and simple... But watch out, because the president has a temper!"
