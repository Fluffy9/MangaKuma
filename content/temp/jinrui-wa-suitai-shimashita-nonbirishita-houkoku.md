description: "In the centuries to come, humankind as we know it will be all but extinct. Tiny fairies become the dominant species on Earth. This series of laid-back reports follows one of the few surviving humans, a girl who tries to befriend and study the fairies while also digging up relics of our civilization (CDs, etc) to her great wonderment."
