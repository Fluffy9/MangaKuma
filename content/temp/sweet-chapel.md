description: " Haruma Shinohara has always been looked at as someone who is frightening and cold. With his attitude no one would have figured out that a first year, Tetsubei, had crumpled that exterior by stumbling upon Haruma's weakness. A oneshot about an unexpected secret, and the development of a sweet relationship."
