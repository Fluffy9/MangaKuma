description: "In the Keisei High School infirmary, the school’s doctor is regularly visited by Atsuki, the frail and handsome ‘School Prince’. They grow closer over tea and biscuits, but could Atsuki’s feelings be real or are they merely being used to escape his loneliness from the death of his parents? And could love bloom successfully between a teacher and their student?"
