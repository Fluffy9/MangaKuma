description: "Tsuki no Tsubasa is the story of a group of vampires who are being hunted down by the creations of Dr. Victor Frankenstein. The twist here is that the vampires want nothing more than to be left alone and do their best to not kill anyone... and Frankenstein's creations are all in the form of attractive psychogirls of varying ages."
