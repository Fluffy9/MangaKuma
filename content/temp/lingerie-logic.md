description: "From Intercross & Shoujo Crusade: Yuzu has always been a tomboy so she is worried that other girls will make fun of her underwear during the class trip. Without a second thought she asks her male friend, Ken, to help her chose better lingerie. However, right after this, Yuzu can't understand why she can't act like usual around him anymore."
