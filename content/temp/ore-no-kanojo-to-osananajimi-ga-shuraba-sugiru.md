description: "Eita enters high school aiming for the National University School of Medicine. Because of his parents' divorce--and his goal--he shuns anything to do with romance or love. One day Masuzu, the school beauty with the silver hair, who's just returned to the country, enters his life in a most unexpected way. Chiwa, his childhood friend since elementary school, will not let this go without a fight."
