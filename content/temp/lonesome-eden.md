description: "Two stories. The main one spans five chapters. The protagonist is God's beloved puppet who lives in a huge garden. Out of loneliness, the puppet seeks company. God grants that, but with certain conditions... In the second story, an angel is kicked down (literally) to Earth to experience some hardship as said angel has a problem with granting people's wishes and prayers."
