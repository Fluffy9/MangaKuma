description: " Yawarakai Taion manga summary: Ever since he was a kid, Hoshino Yuuda was forced to care for himself. For someone who grew up all alone, having someone like Saitou Yukihito confessing his wish to die for Hoshino was just plain absurd. Though, thinking that he could make use of Saitou, Hoshino proposed that they should start off as friends. However, will Saitouâ€™s advances lead to something more?"
