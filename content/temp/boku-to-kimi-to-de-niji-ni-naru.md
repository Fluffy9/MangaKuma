description: "Because she loved the word 'wisdom', Rui hated the words 'waste' and 'fuzzy'. One day, a guy named Shou appeared on her life. And thank to that encounter, Rui will suddenly change... And that's the beginning of a 'rainbow school daze' between that super dry girl and that careless guy."
