description: "Years have passed after Yugi's adventures and now it's Yuki Judai's turn. Yuki Judai is a new student in the school Duel Academy, a school dedicated to teach duelist the basics and advanced techniques. Judai is determined to be world's #1 duelist, accepting challenges from his rivals (and friends). Although the manga is based on the anime, the story is really different and unrelated."
