description: "Akari has always lived in the shadow of Yuka, her older sister: less athletic, less smart, less beautiful. When she gets a call from a popular boy in her high school confessing his feelings to her sister, she goes along with the ruse of pretending to be Yuka because she feels bad about turning him down."
