description: "From Animenewsnetwork: Bushidou Sixteen centers around two female competitors of another Japanese tradition, kendou (sword-fighting). Kaori is an accomplished kendou practitioner, but she finds herself facing an unexpected opponent in Sanae, a superficially weaker fighter who bests Kaori in a bout."
