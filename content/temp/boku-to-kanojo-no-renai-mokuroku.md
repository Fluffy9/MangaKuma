description: "It's cute, it's funny, and it's pretty weird. What else do you need? Answer: a main character who doesn't notice that he's living in a dating sim but loves the lolis. It's like TWGOK, but protagonist-kun loves the games AND lolis. Also, he finds a website that accurately predicts his future. Who's seeing his future? How will he use this to acquire lolis?"
