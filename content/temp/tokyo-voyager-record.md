description: " Before handing in his career survey, highschooler Takaya Tsugami was feeling vague and insecure towards his future. What exactly do I want to do? And is it okay to choose it? With feelings like that, Takaya's existence drifts through class. But when unexpected events occur with Rigel Minahashi, who appears as if he lives however his heart desires, will he begin anew? (From Lacy)"
