description: "Taken from Baka-updates: Kaoru Sakurai, the successor of the Sakurai Japanese Dance, made a promise with her childhood friend, Shihou Takaaki, to remain together forever. However, Takaaki left to study in England. Separated for 10 years, Takaaki returns to Japan to become Kaoru's tutor. Yet, Takaaki's uptight and cool demeanor is nothing like the childhood friend Kaoru remembers. How will their relationship progress?"
