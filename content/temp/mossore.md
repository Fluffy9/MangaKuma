description: "Chitose never listens to what people say, he always hears something slightly different from what they actually said. Mostly his results are just frustrating, but when his friends, Yakushima and Haneda, get injured and punished because of his inattention, Chitose knows he has to do something. But when he decides to try mind reading, his results are unexpected to say the least."
