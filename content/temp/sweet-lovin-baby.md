description: "From Lililicious: In 'Sweet Lovin' Baby,' a girl meets a lesbian couple in a bookstore one day. They become fast friends, and she develops feelings for them. But little does she know that they have their own problems to worry about... The title comes from a Laura Nyro song. You can listen to it on her CD New York Tendaberry. Lyrics to the song are included in the zip file.â€¦"
