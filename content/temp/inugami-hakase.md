description: "In Japanese mythology an inugami is a type of shikigami, similar to a familiar spirit, resembling, and usually originating from, a dog, and most commonly carrying out vengeance or acting as guardians on behalf of the inugami-mochi, or 'inugami owner'. Inugami are extremely powerful and capable of existing independently, as well as turning on their 'owners' and even possessing humans."
