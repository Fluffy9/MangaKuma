description: " It all started with the sound of an insect...out of the blue they became feral. Women infected with this sound became known as the 'crazies' who infect other women and attack men exclusively. The resulting chaos devastated Japans populations as 70 percent perished, forcing the international community to cut off Japan from the rest of the world."
