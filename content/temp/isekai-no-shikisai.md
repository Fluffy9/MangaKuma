description: "In the tale, an unnamed narrator pieces together the story of an area known by the locals as the 'blasted heath' in the wild hills west of Arkham, Massachusetts. The narrator discovers that many years ago a meteorite crashed there, poisoning every living being nearby; vegetation grows large but foul tasting, animals are driven mad and deformed into grotesque shapes, and the people go insane or die one by one."
