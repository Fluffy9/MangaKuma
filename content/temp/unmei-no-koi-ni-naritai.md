description: "From Shinmakoku Scanlations: Sometimes, destiny has other plans in motion. It can initiate love out of nowhere, and for Wataru, it's a bad thing. But Tachibana believes that destiny will bring him the true love he's been desperately searching for, only... he's been looking at the wrong direction!"
