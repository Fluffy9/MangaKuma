description: " Basically, the teenage detective kiddo was frozen by some EVIL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR back in near-mid-1900’s, and gets unfrozen in the 2000’s by his granddaughter. Hilarity ensues as he encounters weird new stuff and does silly blunders in his daily life with his granddaughter, Hikari."
