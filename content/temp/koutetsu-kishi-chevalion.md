description: "When the Fullmetal Knights Chevalion defeated the Death Universe, peace returned and the Chevalion members returned to their normal daily lives. Well, except for their leader, Retto. For some reason his suit won't come off. So he's stuck as Chevalion Red, and he has problems controlling his powers."
