description: "Raku Ichijou may be the heir to a yakuza group, but he's a normal high school kid who dreams of nothing more than to live a peaceful life. But when he crosses paths with a super-hot yet violent transfer student, Chitoge Kirisaki, his once normal life takes a sharp turn for the worse!"
