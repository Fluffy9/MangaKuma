description: "Not every person can be happy about having a boyfriend that works as host. Katsuzou is one of those that have something against. To express it he throws at Tomosa (his love interest) a fire extinguisher. Luckily, it didn't kill Tomosa but it seems like he has lost his memory... What in that case will Katsuzou do?"
