description: "From Aerandria Scans: Ryuu, a super-business-like transfer student from England with black hair and blue eyes just arrived! During the night of the Tanabata festival, Ryuu and Yukino became attracted to each other at first sight. He then declares, 'You will be mine!' This brought confusion to Yukino, who has zero experience in love. But could she actually be falling in love?"
