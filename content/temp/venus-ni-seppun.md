description: "From Nakama:Toma and Miyako were raised in the same orphanage. From the moment they met, Miyako has been unable to repress the impulse to soil Toma's beautiful hands. Sadistically embracing Tom is the proof of profoundly sweet love. What awaits the two who wound each other and lick each other's wounds!? The hard Eros of madness and pure love! The forefront of forbidden SM!"
