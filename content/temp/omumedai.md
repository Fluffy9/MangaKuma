description: "From Storm in Heaven: In order to sustain a world on the verge of death, two groups, Blanches and Noires, vie for dreams. Every six months, the group with the fewer dreams has to send a number of members to the human world, where they will eventually die. Heki, a Blanche, fights to get ahead of the game, so he doesnâ€™t have to see his friends shipped off... again."
