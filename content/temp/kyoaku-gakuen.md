description: "Shadow hand that spreads depravity around the world, we call them archvillains! World crisis, religious conflict, territorial dispute, information control, ero-manga regulations... They are at the root of every major social problem(probably)! This is a story about a dreadful institution, 'School of Supreme Evil' that raises archvillains and a police investigator who infiltrated it."
