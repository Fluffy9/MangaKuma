description: "From: http://wiki.puella-magi.net Girl is surrounded by the darkness, with voice calling her out from somewhere. She escapes from the darkness that is inside a suitcase, what appears before her eyes are an unknown room and an unknown man. Only fragments of memories left, and her name, Kazumi."
