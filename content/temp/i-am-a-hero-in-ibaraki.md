description: "Set in Ibaraki, our protagonist is oppressed at home by his in-law family, and constantly bullied at school by his former best friends. His only friend is his pet dog, Iggy, who was rescued just before he was about to be euthanized. Can 'unwanted pets' like them survive the ZQN panic...!?"
