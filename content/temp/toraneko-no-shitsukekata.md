description: " The cute-faced but super strong at fights delinquent - Kotarou, and the excellent, sports all-rounder honors student - Yamato. The two are seen as polar opposites, but theyâ€‹'re actually in a lovey-dovey relationship. Seeing his beloved Yamato's nape and lips fills Kotarou's mind with 'perverted thoughts'. But when he's touched, he panicks and throws a punch...?!"
