description: "Having been dumped ruthlessly by the girl of his dream, Okita Haruto decides that he has had his share of women now. Throwing away his fantasy of going to the same high-school with his (future) girlfriend, he enrolls into an all-boys dormitary high-school. He thought by going to an all-boys school he could have all the time and peace of mind to focus on his study. He's tremendously, horribly, pathetically.......wrong."
