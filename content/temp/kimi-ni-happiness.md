description: "From Leaping into Puddles: Bouyant girl Aizawa Yume falls for the cool boy in her class, Kashiwagi Kou—who tickles people’s noses with a sweet scent and only smiles from time to time. Slowly, Yume develops feelings for Kou-kun... but one day after school, she catches him with Hitohana-san, the girl with a bad personality and equally bad reputation!"
