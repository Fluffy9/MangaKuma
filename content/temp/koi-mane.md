description: " From inmeliora: Chikanari's kouhai, Kamo, is head over heels in love with him, to the point where Kamo does everything in his power to be 'together' with Chikanari - including changing his hair to have the same style and color, and even getting hurt in the same places. Chikanari's view of love is completely different, so how will these two continue their relationship despite all the odds?"
