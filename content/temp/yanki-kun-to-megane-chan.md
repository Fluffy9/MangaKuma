description: "The story starts with a seemingly unassuming class rep Adachi Hana who has taken an interest in the school's known delinquent, Shinagawa Daichi. Just what is her reason for following Daichi and wanting him to go on the class field trip? Included in volume 11 is the story called Fairy Megane, a crossover between Fairy Tail and Yanki-kun to Megane-chan."
