description: "This story is about a 35 year-old man named Sumikawa Kei. His name is very pure, beautiful, and clean. But according to him, he’s the exact opposite of that. Currently, he works at a movie theatre doing part-time. Before that, he was an actor in gay AV. A regular customer, Okazaki, fell in love with Kei at first sight and still sees the beauty of him through his “dark” characteristics."
