description: " As a zombie with memory loss, school life is still a must! While fighting with his instinctive hunger for humans, he also falls in love with his destined lover. Only, it seems like not only does the lover know how he became a zombie, but he was also a schemer behind the scenes. In a SM danmei, the truth of the zombie gradually emerges."
