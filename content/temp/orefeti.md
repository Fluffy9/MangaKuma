description: "This comidic story follows Tamako, an energetic young girl with cat ears and a cat tail (although this doesn't seem to be important), and her family. From a rabbit that comes out of a cooking egg to a bitter disgruntled teacher who writes children's manga, this manga is full of gags and laughs."
