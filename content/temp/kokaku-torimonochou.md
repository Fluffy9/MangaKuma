description: "From iskultrip Scans: Kokaku is a flashy, casual dressing samurai. He's always laying around, but he has no compassion for the wicked! Sneaking into gambling dens and pavilions and beating up the baddies...On top of that, how far would he go for his beloved chile peppers!? The first part of this fire breathing action packed hero's tale!!"
