description: "Mitsuki's a high school freshman worried about her looks--or, at least, her 'baby face'. Until, that is, she enlists a little help from classmate Atsuki and her makeup kit. When Atsuki's finished, the transformation is complete--and breathtaking. It's also when the romantic adventures begin--a roller coaster ride of the heart that young and old are sure to enjoy."
