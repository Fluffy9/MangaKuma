description: "Hina, otherwise known as Guardian Hearts, is sent to Earth on a mission to protect the peace... and with strict orders not to let anyone find out her identity. So when Kazuya accidentally sees Hina transform just when she comes to Earth, he is forced to take her home with him. Because it’s ok to know about a secret identity if you’re family, right? At least that’s what Hina believes!…"
