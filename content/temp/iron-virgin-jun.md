description: "Jun's 18th birthday has been selected by family tradition to be the day that her husband is chosen. Many high-class families have come to try to marry into the physically and economically powerful Asuka dynasty, but Jun is not interested. With her servant Kratta in tow, she runs away from the groom-choosing party."
