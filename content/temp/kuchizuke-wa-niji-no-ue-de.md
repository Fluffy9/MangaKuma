description: "From September Scanlations: Momozu is a frumpy, indoorsy ‘hare-otoko‘, and sunny weather seems to follow him around, while Toyotama is a cheerful, athletic ‘ame-otoko‘ who’s constantly dogged by stormy weather. When the two meet and Toyotama convinces Momozu they should join a mountain-climbing club together, it’s a total case of opposites attracting!"
