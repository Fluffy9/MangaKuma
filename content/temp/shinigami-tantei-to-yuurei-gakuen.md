description: "At the old and abandoned school campus, some students committed suicide in the past, leaving behind a blood curse. A student, dubbed 'Shinigami/ The God of Death' by other students, went exploring the old campus with his friends. Halfway, someone dropped their flashlight and a dismembered woman's body is discovered."
