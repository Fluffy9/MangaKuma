description: "Eiji Otsuka and Sho-u Tajima at it again, Eiji in a much more minor role this time, however. In any case, this a relatively older and short comedy series (4 volumes) that should be a fun break from the mayhem of MPD. In 1994, this manga was published as a whole under title 'BROTHERS High School'."
