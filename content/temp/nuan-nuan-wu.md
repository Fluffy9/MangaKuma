description: "Fenced within a small courtyard is a large tree, and many plants and flowers sing joyfully every day. Sitting on the second story, she drinks tea while painting, bathing in the brilliant sunlight that passes through the trees. The only problem is, the cute delivery guy keeps her waiting. And also-- “Did you drink all of my tea again, Yi Nuan?” Original Webtoon: http://www.u17.com/comic_new.php?comic_id=89155"
