description: "A God Eater consumes the power of impure gods and gains their strength. Koutaro is one of these people. Because of the discrimination and danger that he faces he doesn't have anyone close to him besides his familiar spirit Hinaki. But all that changes when he meets the cheerful Miko, Amane, who is determined to be his traveling companion."
