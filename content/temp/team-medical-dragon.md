description: "Team Medical Dragon focuses around a genius surgeon, Asada Ryutaro, who's methods have made him a bit of a renegade in the eyes of Japanese doctors. The manga exposes the 'illness' of the Japanese hospitals and how their system is not designed to care for the patient. The manga is appropriate for mature audiences and contains blood, nudity, harsh language, and sex."
