description: "Hayasaka Yoshihito was so impressed by lawyer Mikami Haruhiko that he decides to work with him at his small law firm. But it's not quite what Hayasaka's expecting. With the sexually harrassing lawyer Katayama Masaki who doesn't seem to do anything, scary secretary Shingyouji Miho, and Mikami himself who isn't quite the way Hayasaka remembers, things are about to get interesting for an idealistic young lawyer!"
