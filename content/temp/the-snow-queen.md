description: "From Noir: There once was a man called the most brilliant intellectual. And a woman with everything standing at the death's door. Their hearts were so completely frozen solid that nothing could melt them. What kind of light was it that could melt their hearts? ...Love...? If the answer was love, isn't it beyond absurdity?"
