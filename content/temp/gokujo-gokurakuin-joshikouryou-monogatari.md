description: "A story about the humorous misadventures of Akabane Aya, an arrogant high-school girl who's constantly trying to outdo her classmates in everything (especially sex appeal), only to make a fool of herself in the process. Since the story takes place in an all-girls school, expect lots of girls fanservice innuendos without much seriousness."
