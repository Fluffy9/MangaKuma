description: "He was looked down on, forced to break off his engagement, he was murdered, maybe this is the life that trash should haveâ€¦ But he was taken over by me, the strongest cultivator, Cang Kun Zi, as I reborned. Now that I'm here, I'll make the best of it! Watch as I use this trash body of mine to trample upon you mere ants!"
