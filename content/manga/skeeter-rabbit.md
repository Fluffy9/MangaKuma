description: "Usa Ayano is a middle-school girl who is kinda-sorta bad at physical activities. One day at gym class, she sees another girl in her grade, Hoshihara Chika, a transfer student who muddles through the dancing lesson like she couldn't care less.
Ayano, intrigued by how mysterious Chika is, tries to approach the new girl, but gets pushed away. That is until she later discovers Chika's secret...
Uran of the 'Mujaki no Rakuen' fame brings you a story bringing together youth, JCs and dancing!"
