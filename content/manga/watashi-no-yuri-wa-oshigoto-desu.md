description: "Hime is a girl who has developed her cuteness as a deliberate act with the plan of marrying a billionaire. One day she is more or less forced to work as a replacement for a girl injured by bumping into her in the street. The place of work is a concept cafe where the waitresses put on a show as though the cafe were run by the yuri cliche ojousama school. There's a large contrast between the performances and the off-duty staff."
