description: "One day, the cat gods of a shrine that is falling out of use find a human baby left outside, all alone. They decide to take in the baby, who they name Tama, and raise her as their own. Now the little girl Tama, who knows very little about humans, is trying to grant the wishes of anyone who visits their little shrine, using the power of the cat gods!"
