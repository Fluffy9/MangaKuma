description: "Violette, a proud and beautiful daughter of a duke, commits a crime out of jealousy towards her half-sister. Convicted, she faces her own heart with sincerity in a prison cell and regrets her sin. Then time rewinds to a turning pointâ€”to her first meeting with Maryjun one year ago.
Violette makes a decision. She will not make mistakes this time. Without committing a crime and bothering anyone, she will live an ordinary, plain and inconspicuous life...! However, incidents contrary to Violette's expectations occur one after another...?!"
