description: "Lazarus 'Penny' Kind is a notorious gambler. Knowing very well the ins and outs of the bet, he tries his best to break even - after all, making a bunch of money in one gamble would bankrupt the casino and make him a prime target for criminals and thieves.
One night, while idly betting on the roulette wheel, Lazarus suddenly receives a large about of winnings. Not wanting to become the center of attention, he asks the casino to quickly sell him the most expensive item they have. The casino obliges, giving him a mute slave by the name of Lyla the next day."
