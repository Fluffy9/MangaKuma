description: "Set in the political unrest of 1960s Japan, a group of young revolutionaries seek to overthrow the world order by any means necessary. But the path they walk is not of glory, but infamy; the events that unfold will shock the nation of Japan to its very core!
Weaving together both detailed research and dramatic elements, Yamamoto Naoki delivers a powerful new take on the most troubling and infamous episode of the history of Japan's radical left-wing student movement."
