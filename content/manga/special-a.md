description: "Special A manga summary: Her whole life, Hikari Hanazono has been consumed with the desire to win against her school rival, Kei Takishima--at anything. He always comes out on top no matter what he does, and Hikari is determined to do whatever it takes to beat this guy! At age 6 Hikari lost to Kei in an impromptu wrestling match. Now, at 15, Hikari joins 'Special A,' a group of the top seven students at a private academy, for the opportunity to trounce the guy who made her suffer her first defeat. However, Kei's feelings towards Hikari are different."
