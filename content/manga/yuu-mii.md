description: "The title 'Yuu & Mi' is a pun on the English phrase 'You and Me'. Aimu Yuu (remark: his name sounds like 'I'm you') is a boy who just moved into the equivalent of a boarding house.
Everything is not as it first seems, even the boy. Living in the same room is a ghost (female) named Mi. The series is a combination of love, humour, and a general parody of anime and manga. There are a lot of weird characters in this manga."
