description: "This is a story of a man who is cursed to live a life of solitude! Whether the ladies be eight or eighty years old, his cursed ability would affect them. Even the slightest of skin contact would cause any woman to fall into an uncontrollable state of lust and desire. Thus our hero, Sun Lang, journeys through this word in search of a way to lift his curse. He swears upon his life, that before he dies, he will regain the ability to innocently help an old lady cross the road!"
