description: "The creature known as man is quick to misunderstand.
The same applies to the the pure middle-schooler Yokoyama-kun: A diligent fellow who does his infirmary duty properly.
'You're so nice. Thank you.' The one to say that to him was his classmate Nishino-san, so Yokoyama-kun ended up thinking: ('Isn't she only nice to me?!')
He couldn't help but be hopeful. ('Does she like me?!')
This is the start of the misleading life between the fantasizing Yokoyama-kun and the equivocator Nishino-san."
