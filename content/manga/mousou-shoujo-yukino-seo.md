description: "At first sight Jun seems like a hot vamp, however her sexy look is a complete lie.
In reality she is a very shy wallflower. But what's even worse: She is still a virgin! In desperation, she seeks refuge in her erotic daydreams which always turn into some odd situations.
And if that wasn't enough, she also finds out that the man of her dreams lives nearby.
An oblique erotic comedy about the burden of lust!"
