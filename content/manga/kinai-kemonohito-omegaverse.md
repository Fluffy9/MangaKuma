description: "'Bard, make sure you don’t get touched by it.' This is bad, I must stay away from him quickly—. Although he shouldn’t be touched by the albino omega, his whole body which has begun to pulse, & can’t be stopped anymore…?! Bard, an alpha beast man who adores the King and spends his busy days as a crown prince, reunites with Maya, a pure white and beautiful half-beast who couldn’t be forgotten since he saw him once when he was young."
