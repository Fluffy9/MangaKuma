description: "From Animenewnetwork: The story centers on Yosora Fujimitsu, a newly admitted student to North Gate National Military Academy, a school where the elite gather. Yosora possesses both beauty and intelligence, but he immediately feels uneasy at his new school. He thinks, 'At this school, there's some kind of big secret.' A vortex of speculations occupies Yosora as he's led toward that secret."
