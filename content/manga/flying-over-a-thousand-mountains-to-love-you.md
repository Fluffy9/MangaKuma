description: "Flying Over a Thousand Mountains to Love You manga summary: Amongst the swans of England's Swan Lake, I am different. I am a black swan, and the last one able to transform into human form. One time as I peeked my head out from the lake, a ring was thrown in front of me. Because of this ring, I met she-male! Once I found out his true identity, I became his disciple, and somehow also his 100th girlfriend!"
