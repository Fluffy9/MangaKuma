description: "A 5000-year old vegan dragon was living peacefully when one day a young girl showed up in his cave. She offered herself as a sacrifice in order to gain favor for her village. He played along as the great 'Jaryuu-Sama, the Demon Lordâ€™s Army Leader' in order to get rid of her. However, his little white lie awoken her hidden powers and his peaceful life suddenly ended."
