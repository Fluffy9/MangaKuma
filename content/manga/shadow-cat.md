description: "Naji is an ordinary cat who lives in a small village. His occasional mischief caused by his selfish personality lands him in trouble from time to time. One day, Naji ate the sacrificial offering, the Shrimpfish meant for the monster Taowu, who laid waste to the village many years before. To atone for his crime, he is entrusted with the mission of finding another Shrimpfish. However, the legends whisperâ€¦ All cats who eat the Shrimpfish are destined to become monsters."
