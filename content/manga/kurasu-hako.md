description: "Take a peek, if you will, into the private lives of the young and love-struck. Not the public things that everyone sees, but the messy parts that take place in the secrecy of the home. You’ll find that life, like love, is an inexplicable and chaotic thing. All the more entertaining, don’t you think?"
