description: "Summary:
“Hey, hurry up and massacre those bandits!”
“No way, I don’t want to work…”
Spending my daily life in leisure, that was my pastime—until I was summoned into another world and met a blonde loli introducing herself as Dungeon Core No. 695.
“Save my dungeon. By the way, if the dungeon core is destroyed, you’ll also go down with me as the dungeon master.”
A dungeon with a single room. Moreover, one already controlled by bandits. This is a [Checkmate] no matter how you look at it. Guess there’s nothing to do but somehow get out of this situation so that I can [Not Work]!!"
