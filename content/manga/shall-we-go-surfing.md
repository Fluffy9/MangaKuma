description: "How did the phrase 'Surf with me.' became a connotation for 'Sleep with me'? There are strange rumors surrounding Ha Doyoon, and Sung Jin, curious to find the truth behind those rumors, approached him. The events that unfolded during the 3 days that followed only made him more and more confused."
