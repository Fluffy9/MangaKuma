description: "The straight-laced Tatsumi has accepted a new job as a teacher on a small island around the Ogasawara Archipelago named 'Aoshima,' where he encounters unfathomable phenomena that defy all logic. This warm fantasy tale is evocative of nature, in all its mystery and wonder. But is this enchanting isle of blue welcoming him, or......? The island calls out to you, ushering you to a realm on the flipside of the senses. Come enjoy a moment's little miracle in a place where 'common sense' holds little sway!"
