description: "Narumi Rokurou is still adrift in life in his forties, unmarried, and working as an editor at a publishing company while writing hardly lucrative literary fiction. His days enjoying life at his own pace are brought to an end one summer night, when a strange twist of fate brings Rokurou together with a mysterious beauty, beginning the story of their crazed love. As once was spoken by Zarathustra: 'Everything in a woman is a riddle.'"
