description: "Nobuko Tanaka is a college student working part-time at a supermarket. Due to her shy and plain nature, her name is constantly mistaken for “Mobuko,” which has the kanji for “supporting role”. So when she develops feelings for her kind co-worker, Irie, will she be able to gather her courage and grow closer to him? Will this “supporting role” actress finally get a chance in the romantic spotlight?"
